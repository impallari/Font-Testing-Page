font-testing-page
=================

Stable releases available for use at http://www.impallari.com/testing

The Font Testing Page is a tool primarily intended for type designers and independent foundries to 'Drag and Drop' their work in progress into a browser. It can also be used by art directors, graphic designers, teachers and students interested in seeing how a typeface works on the web.

There is a short video demonstrating this tool, http://vimeo.com/40296571

Operation is simple:

- First, you must accept the request from the browser.
- Then drag the font you want to try to the upper area of the Testing Page
- Add more fonts and you'll see their file names and file sizes as buttons

Below the drop area you see some buttons to select different layouts:

- Headlines: Displays examples: 72, 60, 48, 36 and 30 to 12.
- Text: Displays text blocks, from 20 to 10.
- Adhesion: Shows examples using only 'adhesion' text. Intended for the early stages on a typeface design.
- Hamburgefonstiv Examples using 'Hamburgefonstiv' text.
- Lowercase only: Displays examples of 72, 60, 48, 36, 30, 24, 18 and 16 to 10.
- Caps: Displays examples of words in Sentence Case at 60.
- All Caps: Displays examples of words in All-Caps at 60.
- Layout: Displays examples of Headline, Subhead and Body text.
- Kern: Displays examples of combinations of letters and miscellaneous signs.
- Latin: Diacritics for 103 Latin languages, pangrams and text samples.
- Non-Latin: Examples in arabic, armenian, greek, hebrew and +10 Non-Latin languages
- Hinting: Basic Char-set at different sizes to check for hinting problems

Notes:

- Requires Firefox 3.6+/Chrome 13+
- 100% Javascript
- 100% safe: Your fonts are only stored in your own browser (using `localStorage`) and **nothing gets uploaded to any server**
